# Pitch Monitor

<img src="./public/pitchmonitor.svg" height="80" width="80">

This is a proof of concept of a pitch monitor.

It paints lines representing possible notes and dots over those lines according to the pitch received in the recording device. When the dots are near some note (in tune), they are green, otherwise, they are red.

You can see a demo at https://aquelehugo.github.io/pitchmonitor.
